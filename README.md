# Struggle for Gera
This is an original digital card game, currently in the very early pre-alpha development stages.
The [SFG](https://fyuristudios.com) team consists of a group of friends who love to argue about what makes [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/) a bad game, or why [Gwent](https://www.playgwent.com/en) sucks. When we realized that we could do something productive with our arguments like make our own game, we blew our own minds. So here we are. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToZ-R1VW1rttV7YrFwHCyrx4SerWhkX7QIUp_DqHmvk/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to the official rules document. If the rules don't make any sense, sorry: We wrote them, so maybe it only makes sense to us.

## The code
The frontend code is located [here](./static). The backend code is located [here](./base). Tests are located [here](./tests).

The backend code is meant to be run using NodeJS on a server. It serves up a webpage (which is mostly just an embedded JS script, lol.) ```/static``` contains everything regarding the webpage.
