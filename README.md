# The repository currently housing the NodeJS SFG project.
If you're editing this repository, go to the "SFG - 2" folder: That's where this repository is actually being edited. We aren't editing "SFG - 1", it's just a bunch of (mostly useless) Java code that Hughes wrote that we're keeping in case we want reference. Thanks.
## If you want to host your own server, you'll have to set up a port forward on your home router. 
If you need help with that, ask ~~Jesus~~ the Internet. I recommend setting the server up on port 6001 because then you won't have to edit the code at all.
Then, you'll need to run "Server.js" because I haven't properly configured the startup file yet. I'm lazy, sorry.
Something like:
```bash
> cd "~/git/SFG/SFG - 1/base"
> node Server.js
```
If that doesn't work, ask ~~Jesus~~ Hughes for help. Or just ask him to host a server for you since he wrote the source code.
