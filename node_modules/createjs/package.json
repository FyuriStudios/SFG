  "readme": "# Using the CreateJS combined builds #\n\nCreateJS combined builds are a combined and minified version of \n* [EaselJS](http://createjs.com/easeljs)\n* [TweenJS](http://createjs.com/tweenjs)\n* [PreloadJS](http://createjs.com/preloadjs)\n* [SoundJS](http://createjs.com/soundjs)\n\nNote that shared classes are only included once, so these builds are not just concatenated versions of the individual\nlibraries.\n\nIndividual and combined builds in this repository are also available on the [CreateJS CDN](https://code.createjs.com), \nand can be installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/createjs).\n\n### NPM Usage\n```\nnpm install createjs --save\n```\n\nFor the time being, only ES5 versions of CreateJS are available, which can not yet be used with RequireJS, CommonJS, etc.\n\n# Building CreateJS combined builds\nIf you have special requirements, specifically combining your own version of the combined library with specific, custom,\nor the very latest individual libraries, you can install this repository. This process uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) \nto make builds, as well as to update and deploy the CDN index.\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nNode (0.10.x or greater is required):\n\n```\nnode -v\n```\n\nIf your node is out of date, install the latest from:\nhttp://nodejs.org/\n\nAfter node is setup, install the other dependances:\n\n```\n# Install the grunt command line utility\nsudo npm install grunt-cli -g\n\n# Install all the dependencies for this project.\nnpm install\n\n# Make sure you have the latest of all the createjs libraries.\n# Install the dependencies in the build directories for each project, ie EaselJS/build\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Setup\n\nYou'll need to change the default settings to suit your work environment.\nWe have 2 config files:\n\n* config.json - Is meant to be in git and pushed to all developers.\n* config.local.json - Is added to .gitignore and and only for your local setup (any settings in here will override those in config.json)\n\nPlease adjust these settings to match your environment. All paths can either be relative from this folder, or absolute paths.\n\n* easel_path\n* preload_path\n* sound_path\n* tween_path\n\n### Building\nTo export a release build for this library run:\n\n```\ngrunt build\n```\n\nThis command will:\n\n* Execute each libraries corresponding build or next tasks.\n* Combine all the CreateJS classes into a single file.\n* Remove any duplicate classes (Things like Event, EventDispatcher)\n* Minify the combined file\n\nTo build the NEXT version run:\n\n```\ngrunt next\n```\n\nDoes the exact same process as above but uses NEXT as the version.\n\n### Main commands\n* `grunt build` - Builds all the projects and creates combined / minified files\n* `grunt next` - Same as build, but uses the NEXT version.\n* `grunt core` - Only run the global tasks (only, concat and minify js files, copy the examples and source to other folders.\n* `grunt js` - Only uglify and concat the javascript.\n* `grunt cdn` - Builds a new CDN index page and copies all required script files to build. (To build all libs and the cdn run grunt cdn:build or grunt build cdn)\n* `grunt design` - Build the CDN/ folder, which is deployed at https://code.createjs.com",
